# Zero Core Components

Components that are not extensive enough to require their own dedicated module live in a general components directory in the root of the Zero Core module. These components tend to be less deeply feature rich and more oriented around UI and simple user interactions that appear commonly across projects - for example; the need to make a selection with a dropdown menu.

All components in this directory are plug 'n play by nature and, through the use of[ Vue slots](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html), offer complete customization of styling if visual elements are involved.
